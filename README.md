# The Game Of Life - a command-line based game project
This project was me and my project team's final project for the Laurea University of Applied Sciences' Fundamentals of Programming course. The course was about the basics of programming using Java and IntelliJ development environment (IDE).

# About the project
This project is a command-line based game. The player makes decisions that take them to different outcomes in life. The game has three different paths to follow. The player's decisions take them forward in the game. Some encounters are randomized so the player has no influence on them. The game is supposed to be played untill there is no questions remaining.
